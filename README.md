# Speech Recognition
Performs speech recognition on the LibriSpeech dataset. Uses an end-to-end model based of Baidu's Deep Speech 2. Implemented in Keras and TensorFlow.

Still very much a work in progress pending access ot a strong GPU. These networks are really big and require huge amounts of computational power.

Written as my final project for an Oxford course in [Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017).
